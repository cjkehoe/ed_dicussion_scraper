    "content": "Question: User Stories for HW 2 and Task 1\n\nFrom reading all the Ed Discussion posts I have deciphered that we need to decide which user stories apply to CRUD functionality. As far as I am concerned the only two items in the user story that applies strictly to CRUD are: As a student, I can see a list of questions others have asked that might be related to a question I am about to ask, so I do not waste my time waiting for answers already there, and others donâ€™t waste their time reading and answering my question As a student, I can see a list of all unresolved questions and a list of the current potential answers for each so I can evaluate the potential answers and, if appropriate, propose a new potential answer without duplicating the work of others. And then I am implicitly adding a user story (which wasn't included in the document), that the user can modify and delete their questions/answers. This should cover all the bases of CRUD. So I just have three total user stories (for task 1). Two from the document and one that I inferred. Would this be a safe and correct approach?",

This has been standard for UML diagrams. However no where in my investigation does this assignment specify what is expected for our UML diagrams. Based on the assignment description I looked here: \" Be sure to produce four UML Class Diagrams and at least one Sequence Diagram using the provided samples in the \"Architecture and Design Documents\" portion of the \"Individual Homeworks and Team Projects\" Module\" However, none of the provided examples are UML diagrams, only state machine, sequence diagrams, and High-Level Startup Flow diagrams. As far as the sequence diagram is concerned, expectations are fully specified (examples are given). I appreciate any clarification thank you.\n\n\nAnswer: [STAFF RESPONSE] There are examples in the textbook that can help you. If you have questions about one of the examples, please visit one of the numerous office hours available.",

This is a requirement because CRUD operations (from my understanding) have to do with creating, reading, updating, and deleting. So I THINK those are in relation to how they operate in the database. If not then whatever it's extra work and it teaches me stuff anyways. Plus I have the CRUD operations completed with functionality so it can't be marked down anyways.",

I am going to do all what is needed from me in the Template and added these extra features is this fine, or that will affect me not getting full grade?\n\n\nAnswer: Based on common responses in Ed discussion about extra features, simply put, as long as deliverables have been met, you can add extra features. (they won't contribute to the assignment grade, ie extra credit)\n\n\nAnswer: [STAFF RESPONSE] Yes, but make sure you highlight the basic requirements first in your submission so as to make it easier for the graders to grade\n\n\nAnswer: [STAFF RESPONSE] There is no need to sign in to HW2. There are no roles. You are just creating and testing classes you will need to use in TP2. Please read the deliverables for each assignment carefully. Where does it suggest that you need to log in?",
