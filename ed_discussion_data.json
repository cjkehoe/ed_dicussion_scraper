Also, it really helps to think about SQL databases as an excel spreadsheet, where your columns are the attributes your class has (User has an id, name, email, password) and the rows are your entries. Those would make up your table. SQL is very specific - it doesn't like Strings where Ints are supposed to be for example! You can't insert a new entry that has only 2 columns (aka attributes) into a table that has 4 columns (aka attributes). SQL also lets you search and filter your entries in a given table! :0) Definitely read up on it because you will need it later, and it's super useful in the industry. Don't try to become an expert though (at least not yet), get the knowledge you need and keep on goin'!"

    "content": "Hi all, Here is my understanding of HW2 from the Individual Homework 2 document on Canvas. We are supposed to create a standalone program that can do CRUD operations and input validation for a question and answer system. You may implement this from Foundation Code, HW1, or your TP1 code. You pick a subset of user stories from \"Student\" that you think best cover what is required for CRUD/input validation - it's vague because it is up to your best judgement. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. Input validation is how you make sure your database is secure when allowing users to enter things directly into your database. If you're taking 365, think SQL injection and all the things that can go wrong there. Note that it is standalone. I don't think this means it isn't related to HW1 or our team projects -- Instead, I think it means it is a more simple adaptation, requiring only enough to get these basic functionalities in place and not worry about roles and their effect on what a user can do. It is to practice on a smaller scale and get a working idea of what we will implement, before we actually implement it into the team project. You should think like this too! It's just a mini version of the Q&A system we are developing. In the document it says to create: a question class an answer class a questions class that supports storing all current questions as well as any subset of the questions (e.g., a subset reflecting the results of a search) an answers class that supports storing all potential answers to all stored questions and any subset of potential answers to a question (e.g., a subset reflecting the results of a search) Lets look a little deeper here. The question class represents a single question and all of the data associated with it (Think: how are questions displayed on EdDiscussion? What information do they have?) Same with the answer class, but for answers to questions. Think about that relationship. What about the last two? (TAs please correct me if I'm wrong) I think these are to manage a collection of questions/answers, maybe like a category of questions (on EdDiscussion, \"Assignments\" questions vs \"Exams\" questions) or answers related to a question (q: \"What is the meaning of life?\", answers: \"42\", \"Playing with my dog\", \"Making an impact\" (where the question and answer classes are just simple strings). What might that data look like? How might we interact with it? Remember we can have multiple collections, collections that are empty, have a few entries, or that 1000s of entries. Do some research on collections of data like this, it'll help a lot down the line. We are urged to discuss \"potential attributes\" for these classes with each other on EdDiscussion. Again, this is vague because it is up to you! Talk to others about these and learn from others' previous experiences. Documentation and automated testing is still important. Use JavaDoc comments for documentation, they're pretty cool. Automated testing is like in TP1 still. No need to worry about JUnit, if you don't want to. Read the deliverables and note theres a lot planning, documentation, diagrams, and testing in the deliverable PDF. And finally a screencast to explain and show off your work. K. I. S. S. (Keep it simple silly) method for the screencast, so you don't bore your grader :P I think I got everything! So, to recap: Create a standalone, mini question and answer system based off of a subset of the student user stories that best cover CRUD operations and input validation. It can be started from Foundation Code, HW1, or TP1. Make your own separate Github repository for this homework. Don't fork - If you fork, it will make the repository public and we don't want that! Better to download as a zip, open it, and initialize a new repository from it. You need to code 4 new classes and write database operations for them (CRUD). Their inputs should be validated to prevent saving bad data into our DB. If you're Staff and notice something is wrong with my interpretation, please let me know!",

I believe the Canvas shell has been configured incorrectly due to the way it combines the different sections of this class, the hybrid and online students. Here are two examples of different instances when I cannot view an image properly: I discovered that this course has two different folders, 210566 and 215181 for storing course content. If the image is stored under 210566, the image is viewable: If the image is stored under 215181, the image is not viewable: The solutions are to either only put images in the correct folder, or to correct whatever is causing the Shell to be 'divided' between online and hybrid students",

There is currently a upcoming due assignment regarding to a Week 03 Class Participation for Febuary 2 and the specificaitons for this assignment is not stated in the sub-section of the homework leading to same issue in the beggining of the course.

You can practice this with your homework assignments and reach out to your team in case someone knows more or you can all learn together.

My team is aware we should complete user stories from New Users and Admin, including some new ones or at least better informed ones from our research on real-world applications/websites. During the live event, Dr. Carter stated that in real life it is not wise to simply add things to the user stories given to you by stakeholders. The reason was because if it ended up being a waste of time or adding cost, the team could end up paying for this. Is this something we are replicating in this course? Do I need to get confirmation about adding new things to my user stories from stakeholders (Professors, TAs, Graders)? If so, do I do this via EdDiscussion? Also during the live event, Dr. Carter stated we should complete 'some' user stories (from New Users and Admins), but didn't specify how much we are truly expected to do for Phase I. Based on the Phase I instructions and deliverables, it is clear we need to work with new inputs and validation for those new inputs (i.e. improve the sign flow for the 'first' user role and all New Users). However, are we also expected that we implement new roles (Student, Instructors, Reviewers, Staff) and the invitation code functionality that must come with it? Are we expected to implement the list of user accounts, adding and removing roles, deleting users functionalities for Admins? Are we expected to implement the 'Choose a Role' Page for users with multiple roles? Are we expected to show any information on the Role specific pages yet, not including Admin? Also, the online class is still missing the Template .docx for Phase I. Here is a bulleted list of my questions to make it easier to read: Do I need to get confirmation about adding new things to my user stories from stakeholders (Professors, TAs, Graders)? If so, do I do this via EdDiscussion? Are we expected to implement all features described in New Users and Admins epics? If not, which ones are we expected to complete for Phase I exactly? Are we expected that we implement new roles (Student, Instructors, Reviewers, Staff) and the invitation code functionality that must come with it? Are we expected to implement the list of user accounts, adding and removing roles, deleting users functionalities for Admins? Are we expected to implement the 'Choose a Role' Page for users with multiple roles? Are we expected to show any information on the Role specific pages yet, not including Admin? The online class is still missing the Template .docx for Phase I. Can this be provided today? Please give me definitive answers. I would like to create an environment of calm and complete understanding of tasks for my team. This would really help me accomplish this! Again, I truly appreciate your work answering the constant influx of questions on here! It's difficult to keep up with and has been helping me immensely. I hope I can give back to my classmates by asking these here. Thank you for your time and knowledge :o) If you have further questions for me, let me know! Thank you, Amelia - Online Team 3",

So for example, customer can be very vague about what they they want, so it's your task a software engineer to decipher their needs. In this class, the professors and us TAs would serve as customers, so it's always better to confirm with us through Live Sessions, Office Hours, Ed Discussions if the functionality you are thinking of adding is actually aligning with the customer requirements 2. You are to implement all the user stories of New User and Admin, however, for the functionalities/roles that are yet to be implemented, you can use placeholders for those things. For example, Admin can assign the user any roles during invitation (have that flexibility), What happens to a user with a specific role is not required at this phase, only confirm that the role is assigned. (Further clarifications in office hours as needed) 3. You are to implement the option to assign/select new roles (think of it as just a label at this point) 4. Yes, but it does not have to be through a persistent way (using database) at this phase 5. Yes, again assume merely assigning different label at this point 6. No 7. The template will be provided over the weekend (it will be similar to HW1 template) Thank you for understanding and keep asking questions if any other ambiguity arises."

This meeting must be recorded and submitted with thew two other required screencasts described below in Task 7. (Consider using Zoom to do the recording.). The purpose of this communications meeting is to identify activities where collaboration may be required. Waiting until integration to discover that two or more team members made changes to the same set of classes (methods and attributes) without agreeing on what those changes need to be can be catastrophic! The meeting is not a problem solving meeting. (For more about this kind of meeting read this article, Daily Scrum MeetingLinks to an external site..\""

Please someone correct me if I'm wrong, because I agree, it was fairly unclear. I don't think I'll know for sure until the template is posted. EDIT: I just saw this passage in the team project overview: The team will also implement a set of new user stories specified in the Team Project 1 assignment, integrate them into a well-functioning application, and document the application in a manner similar to the provided code. The specific user stories that are to be implemented have not yet been specified, it's not in the assignment.

This Live Event will ask you to collaborate with one or two other students after the event on some aspect of the work needed to move Team Project forward, capture notes from that collaboration, and submit those for your Class Participation Assignment. For online students, these class participation assignments are due just before midnight on Sunday. If you can't join us live and you have questions, reply to this post with the questions you have and we will try to answer them all during the Live Event along with the questions those attending may have. I hope you can join us this Thursday.",

I also did not see an \"errorLabel\" code in the code provided so I assumed the admin setup page test cases would not be in the criteria.

Firstly, the list of special characters is different from the one provided in the PasswordEvaluator (\"~`!@#$%^&*()_-+={}[]|\\\\:;\\\"'<>,.?/\"). Does this mean that there is a delineation that needs to be added between the special characters and other characters in the PasswordEvaluator? Also, according to the FSM an equal sign would qualify as an \"other character,\" not a special character. But that means the password will stop being validated once it reaches an equal sign or an \"other character.\" For example, take the password \"4fh=aS2\" then the FSM will transition from state 0 to state 1. But now there is no transition out of it so you can't check any more characters. Unless I am interpreting this wrong, I can't imagine this is the expected behavior. Not to mention once it reaches the \"other character transition\" there is nothing to check if the password is long enough. If it encounters OtherChar is it supposed to just thrown an error immediately?",

For step 5 we are told to create a new FSM with the requirements which are listed in that step, then we need to implement the steps in our code by duplicating the foundationalCode into a new file named HW1? But then for step 8, we are supposed to implement the FSM in the image by changing our code? So are we supposed to combine the 2 FSM's into one code file named HW1? Or are we supposed to do it separate for each FSM? Then, step 7 says, \"Modify the UserNameRecognizer class inside of UserNameRecognizerConsoleTestbed\" but i have seen people say we need to modify other files... what exactly do we need to change? Also, one of the deliverables states,\" Testing of the two implementations has been performed,\" so this means we need to implement/modify the HW1 file 2 times? Thank you!",

However, since that's now out of the way, the assignment fails to SPECIFICALLY state HOW the code from the testbeds should be used in HW 1. To better emphasize/explain this concern, I was (and still am) massively confused as to whether I'm supposed to write entirely unique code, or if I'm ALLOWED to take pre-existing code from the testbeds and other files for the sake of accomplishing implementation of the two FSMs. (It should be noted that these are only a FEW of MANY unanswered questions and issues with the instructions after having read over them many times and watching all of the videos. The videos were mainly showing installation and they were insanely useful). Honestly, as a student who cares about my grade and gets very frustrated with assignments that are poorly created (as even one of the TAs ALSO told me in a zoom call), I wonder how much my grade will suffer going forwards in terms of losing points because I did assignments entirely incorrectly due to extremely vague instructions. Please reassure me that I'm not going crazy because I have watched ALL of the videos, and have correctly followed the rubric but at the same time I feel like I'm gambling with these instructions. I shouldn't be forced to join office hours to get a basic understanding of even what's asked of me. For further clarification, I have finished the assignment and am happy with the result; I just wish it wasn't so unnecessarily puzzling, vague, and stressful to do so purely due to the instructions provided. I should also state that I'm only being so critical because I enjoy this class and I want it to be better for everyone going forwards. So, please don't take the post as if I'm being hostile. Also not posting this under anonymous for the sake of pure honesty and genuineness. Thank you guys for what you do staff but if assignment instructions continue to be this vague then I guess I'll just have to prepare for that as unfortunate as it is.",

To clarify even more, if the username is alex. , the final state will be state 2 which is not accepted state so the userName will be discarded anyway. But let's say if the userName is A.

Should we just edit and reuse the given code from the two classes, or should we write most of our own classes from scratch? How much of the original code should we be reusing?

Am I only allowed to interview people from Group 2? Can I also interview people from groups 1 or 3? Why does the Team Formation assignment leave entries for 5 Candidates if we are only supposed to do 3 interviews? I also see that the Team Formation assignment is worth literally 0 points. So do I really need to submit it? Is it possible to submit an empty assignment with my name on it just so I can make it on to a team? What does it mean to \"work with a friend of your choice\"? Is a \"friend\" anyone in the class or does it have to be someone from Group 2 (i..e, your assigned group)? Do we need to interview our \"friend\" in addition to the 3 interviews? What do we do if we are unable to find a \"friend\"?",

Everyone is required to write their answers independently and submit original work. Failure to do so will result in an academic integrity violation.

The online class has three random groups and asks those individuals to engage in discussions and self-select teams. The in-person class requires students to interview people and fill out a form based on those interviews, submitting it, and the instructional staff will form the teams."

If a team member does to respond to emails and does not attend and participate in the two (or more) weekly team meetings, a member of the team will engage with the member of the instructional team (e.g., a grader) assigned to that team, explain the situation, and work to get it resolved. 2. If a team member becomes ill and is having difficulty functioning, that team member must inform the rest of the team of the situation and work to find common ground about what is expected of the ill member after recovering from the illness to be a member in good standing with the rest of the team. (The former ill student will take on extra work to help improve the team's project to make up for the time that member was unable to participate. The whole team needs to agree that the agreement is reasonable and fair to the whole team.) What are problems you have seen? Described the situation that has occurred and will likely happen again. Do not provide your recommendation for the team norm. Each team must select a list of issue that are likely or probable and come up with the expectation for the whole team should that issue become a reality for the team. If you have questions, doubts, or suggestions for improvement to the above, so we can all better benefit from the wealth of experience you all bring.",
